## Implementation for YOLOV3 written in Tensorflow 2.

It's currently a work in progress!

To-Do:
1. Verfiy Darknet53 implementation can classify on a well known classification problem with a high score.
2. Implement YOLO layer
3. Verify Detection Head Outputs
4. Verify expected loss, gradients and back-prop.
5. Create skip-connection based custon ResNet-like Darknet conv layers, yolo-layer, etc.
6. Code cleanup and reusability changes.
